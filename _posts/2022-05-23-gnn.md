- From [Graph Representation Learning Book](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/)
   - in node classification for a graph, we have access for a full graph, including both labeled and unlabeled nodes 
      - training models with both labeled and unlabled data is semi-supervised learning 
      - the standard semi-supervised learning still require the i.i.d assumption, but node classification does not satisfy i.i.d
