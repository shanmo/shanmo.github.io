From [Graph Representation Learning Book](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/)

- in node classification for a graph, we have access for a full graph, including both labeled and unlabeled nodes 
   - training models with both labeled and unlabled data is semi-supervised learning 
   - the standard semi-supervised learning still require the i.i.d assumption, but node classification does not satisfy i.i.d
