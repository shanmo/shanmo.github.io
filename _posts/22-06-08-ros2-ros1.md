This post will cover the process for using ROS1 rosbag for ROS2. Specifically, the ROS1 version is `neotic` and the ROS2 is `galactic` with the Rust wrapper. 

The tool we need is [Rosbags](https://ternaris.gitlab.io/rosbags/), which provides the reader and writer and both ROS1 and ROS2. The installation step is `pip install rosbags`. Firstly, we deserialize the topics from the ros1 bag. Secondly, use the writer from `from rosbags.rosbag2 import Writer` to serialize the topics to ros2 bag. 

One thing to note is how to convert the compressed image to raw image. I tried `image_transport`, but it's not supported by conda version of ROS1 installed via [robostack](https://robostack.github.io/noetic.html). 
It turns out that we can construct the raw image type using `rosbags`, i.e. `msg = Image(msg.header, msg_raw.height, msg_raw.width, msg_raw.encoding, msg_raw.is_bigendian, msg_raw.step, msg.data)`, where `msg` is the compressed image from ros1 bag, and `msg_raw` is the converted raw image. 
The output size of raw image is confusing, as it is not something like `848x480x3` format. Based on [this](https://gist.github.com/awesomebytes/958a5ef9e63821a28dc05775840c34d9), I found that we need to use `cv2.imdecode` to decode the raw image data. 
In Rust, we could do 
```rust 
pub fn cv_bridge(img: &r2r::sensor_msgs::msg::Image) -> cv2::core::Mat {
    let buf = img.data.as_slice(); 
    let src = Mat::from_slice::<u8>(buf).unwrap();
    let img_rgb: Mat = cv2::imgcodecs::imdecode(&src, cv2::imgcodecs::IMREAD_COLOR).unwrap();
    return img_rgb;
}
```

So far I have outlined the steps for the rosbags. If we want to convert the messages online, we need to use [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge), which seems to take some time to compile. Some examples of using ros1 bridge can be found [here](https://github.com/mabelzhang/ros1_bridge_sandbox).
